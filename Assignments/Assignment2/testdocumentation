Our testing of the csc488.cup file consisted of 100 automatically generated
programs to test syntax errors (a mixture of valid and invalid programs).
We also hand made a bunch of tests to handle corner cases. Our syntactically
correct programs from assignment 1 were also tested against the parser.

The name of each program that we made briefly describes what is being tested,
while the generated programs are named 1 to 100. Except for the generated
tests, our tests are simple enough that their meaning can be grasped at a glance.
